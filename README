# Pre
lerna-semantic-release pre # Set up the versions, tags and commits

# Perform
lerna-semantic-release perform # Publishes to npm

# Post
lerna-semantic-release post # Generates a changelog in each package in a file
named CHANGELOG.md - will not commit or push that file any more after version
7.0.5 any more. If you want to do something with it, you will need to do this
manually.

This will publish all npm packages, including creating commits and tags for
each release, in the format that lerna expects for the `lerna updated` command.
